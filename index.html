        <h4 class="text-center">Upgrade Shops General Rules</h4><br>
        <p>Each snake parts, including head and eggs, you have on the board gives you one requirement point and a super
            snake part gives you 3 requirement points.<br>
            you can use these points to take an upgrade card from the shops.<br>
            you can have as many upgrade cards you want, as long as their total requirements points is less than or equal to your total
            requirement points.
            Otherwise you need to discard as many upgrade cards needed to reach this condition.
        </p>
        <p>There should always be three upgrade cards in each shop.
            ( 3 red cards and 3 golden cards ).<br>
            When a player takes a card from a shop, replace it with another card with the same color imediatly.
        </p><br>
        <p>You can use your upgrade cards at any time you want.<br>
            If there isn't any upgrade card that you like in the nest upgrade shop
            You may loose a body part on the board to refresh the shop(s).
            <small>You can't do this if
                you are
                not

        <p>Nests are marked on the board. When you enter a nest, you can take any minor upgrade cards in the shop.<br>
            The number shown on top of each upgrade card is
            the amount of requirement points they need for you to be able to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Minor upgrade cards ( red color ) are temporary and should be discarded after usage.

        <p>Thron is placed exactly in the middle tile of the board.<br>
            When you are in the thron you can take <strong>both major and minor upgrade cards.</strong><br>
            Major upgrade cards are <strong>permanant</strong> but you still need to have the minimum requirment
            points on the board to keep them,
            otherwise
            you
            should discard the card(s) that passed your requirement point limit.
