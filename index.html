            <h3 class="text-center">How To Play</h3>
            <p>Sneaky Snakes is played in rounds, each round is made up of the following three phases:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Board Preperation Phase</li>
                <li>The Stratagy Phase</li>
                <li>The Movement Phase</li>
            </ol>
            <!-- The board preperation Phase -->
            <h5>The Board preperation Phase</h5>
            <p>Roll 2 dices of red and green.
                the red one shows the number of the nest/center and the green one shows the number of the tile in that
                nest/center.
                Put one super snake part in this tile.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- The Stratagy Phase -->
            <h5>The Stratagy Phase</h5>
            <p><strong>All players do this phase simultaneously.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Draw 9 cards from the top of your movement cards deck. Choose 5 of them and place them, facedown, on your
                plan slots.<br>
                These 5 cards will show how you plan to move in the board in the order you place them.<br>
                After filling all the 5 slots with a movement card, put the other 4 cards in your discard pile.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What should I do if the movement cards in my draw pile is less than 9 cards?</strong><br>
                keep the ones that are left(if any), shuffle your discard pile, and place it in your draw pile.<br>
                Now take as many cards as you need, from the top of the draw deck to reach 9 cards. Continue as before.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- The movement phase -->
            <h5>The Movement Phase</h5>
            <p>Start moving your snake step by step based one the movement cards that you put on your plan slots, in the
                stratagy phase.
                Each time you move forward you should place a tail part, from your reserve snake parts, in the path you
                just
                passed and grow your tail.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why do you want to grow your tail?</strong> The tail/body parts on the board are the requirement
                for upgrading.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What happens if you run out of reserve parts?</strong> Just continue your path without putting
                any
                parts on the board.
            </p>
            <!-- Priority -->
            <h6>Who moves first? ( Priority )</h6>
            <p><strong>When priority is important?</strong> During the movement phase and shoping, players must
                determine
                priority to see who goes first.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>How deos the priority works?</strong> The black numbers of each tile shows the priority. The
                higher
                number has the
                higher priority.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What happens if players have the same priority?</strong> Roll a dice. The higher number
                determines
                who goes first.
            </p>

        <!-- Steal an egg -->

            <p> When you enter a middle tile of a nest/minor shops. you steal the egg in that tile. (If there is one!
                and
                even if it's the same color egg as your snake ).<br>
                Put the egg on the bored as you add a body part to your snakes tail. Take the egg to the Major shop (

                his/her
                tail to take that card.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Allways fill the shop after someone buys a card.</strong> There should always be three upgrade
                cards
                in each shop ( six In total ). When a player takes a card from
                a shop, replace it with another card with the same color imediatly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>When can I use the upgrade cards? You may use your upgrade card at anytime during the stratagy or
                    movement phase.</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>What if none of the cards in the shop are useful to me?</strong><br>
